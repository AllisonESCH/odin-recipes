        <h1>Sardine Bento Box from <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em></h1>

        <img src="../images/bento.png">

        <p>"My Neighbor Totoro" is all about the bonds of sisterhood, and the dainty bento lunch Satsuki makes her younger sister Mei. While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bento">bento</a> boxes have a long history in Japanese culture, they are often associated with sharing creativity and care with their recipients, as seen in Satsuki's rendition.</p>
